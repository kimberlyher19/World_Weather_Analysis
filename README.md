Module 6 Challenge

Background
Data's true power is its ability to definitively answer questions. So, let's take what you've learned about Python requests, APIs, and JSON traversals to answer a fundamental question: "What is the weather like as we approach the equator?"

Part 1: WeatherPy

Part 2: VacationPy

The output_data folder contains graph visuals and the cities.csv file.  

I referenced a lot of my codes from the activites and I also used ChatGPT for assistance when my codes weren't running properly. 

It was a fun Challenge creating weather visuals and maps that came in handy for Project 1.
